For my soundscape project, I started with four tracks, which I have now boiled down to three. I was planning on having all of these tracks occur at the same time in order to create a more well rounded experience of the sounds I hear from my balcony. However, after considering the long term goals of this project, I instead staggered a lot of those tracks to different places, which makes my project longer as well as giving the recording phases rather than just compiled noises. I chose to order my tracks in a particular order based on how much is going on within them, and overall wanted the soundscape to crescendo and then decrescendo to a close, which I feel like I am closer to achieving than I was.

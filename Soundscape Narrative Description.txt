For my soundscape project, I started with four tracks, which I have now boiled down to three. I was planning on having all of these tracks occur at the same time in order to create a more well rounded experience of the sounds I hear from my balcony. However, after considering the long term goals of this project, I instead staggered a lot of those tracks to different places, which makes my project longer as well as giving the recording phases rather than just compiled noises. During the beginning stages of this project, I wanted my soundscape to represent how it feels to sit on the balcony attached to my room here in Pittsburgh. Seeing other people’s projects in class and what they mean to them, the meaning of my project started to shift for me. I struggle with anxiety and my therapist frequently recommends that I meditate. I try meditating and relaxing when I sit outside on the balcony, but since I grew up in a Massachusetts suburb, I don’t hear “city noises” a lot. After some time, this audio started to represent how it feels to try and meditate on the balcony with all the city noises, and I encourage anyone who listens to this to try and relax and listen.
